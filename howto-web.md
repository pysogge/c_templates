To create a web user interface (UI) in C, you will need to use a library or framework that provides the necessary functions and abstractions for building web applications. Here are a few options you might consider:

Civetweb: Civetweb is a lightweight, embedded C web server that can be used to build web UIs and other types of web applications. It includes support for serving static files, handling HTTP requests and responses, and using templates to generate dynamic HTML pages.
libmicrohttpd: libmicrohttpd is a C library for creating HTTP servers and clients. It provides a simple, lightweight interface for handling HTTP requests and responses, and can be used to build web UIs and other types of web applications.
libwebsockets: libwebsockets is a C library for building web sockets applications. It provides a simple, lightweight interface for handling web sockets connections and messages, and can be used to build real-time web UIs and other types of web applications.
Wt: Wt (pronounced "witty") is a C++ web application framework that can be used to build web UIs and other types of web applications. It provides a high-level, widget-based interface for building interactive web UIs, and supports a wide range of features such as server-side rendering, event handling, and data binding.
GTK+: GTK+ is a C library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that can be used to build desktop applications. It includes support for creating web UIs using the WebKitGTK+ library, which provides a web rendering engine and API for building web applications that run in a native GTK+ window.
