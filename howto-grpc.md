To receive shared memory (shm) file paths via gRPC messages in a C program, you will need to use the gRPC C library and define a gRPC service that includes a method for receiving the file paths.

Here is an example of how you might set up a gRPC service in C to receive shm file paths:

First, you will need to install the gRPC C library and set up the necessary dependencies for your project. You can find instructions for installing the gRPC C library on the gRPC website.
Next, you will need to define a protobuf file that specifies the gRPC service and the methods that it will support. For example, you might define a service like this:
```
service ShmService {
  rpc SendShmFilePath(ShmFilePathRequest) returns (ShmFilePathResponse);
}

message ShmFilePathRequest {
  string file_path = 1;
}

message ShmFilePathResponse {
  bool success = 1;
}
```
This service defines a single method SendShmFilePath that takes a ShmFilePathRequest message as an argument and returns a ShmFilePathResponse message. The ShmFilePathRequest message contains a single field file_path that is used to pass the shm file path. The ShmFilePathResponse message contains a single field success that is used to indicate whether the file path was received successfully.

Use the protoc tool to generate the necessary C code for the gRPC service and the request and response messages. This will generate a header file and a source code file for the service, as well as a header file and a source code file for each of the request and response messages.
In your C program, include the generated header files and use the functions provided by the gRPC C library to set up a gRPC server and implement the SendShmFilePath method.
Here is an example of how you might implement the SendShmFilePath method in C:

```
// SendShmFilePath implementation
grpc_status_code SendShmFilePath(grpc_call *call, const ShmFilePathRequest *request, ShmFilePathResponse *response) {
  // Save the file path
  char *file_path = request->file_path;
  // Set the success field in the response message
  response->success = true;
  return GRPC_STATUS_OK;
}
```
This implementation receives a ShmFilePathRequest message as an argument and saves the file path from the file_path field. It then sets the success field in the ShmFilePathResponse message to true to indicate that the file path was received successfully.
