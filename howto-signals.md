Create a sigset_t variable to hold the set of signals that you want to block. You can use the sigemptyset function to initialize the signal set to be empty.
```
sigset_t sigset;
sigemptyset(&sigset);
```
Use the sigaddset function to add the specific signals that you want to block to the signal set. For example:
```
sigaddset(&sigset, SIGINT); // Add SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to the signal set
sigaddset(&sigset, SIGTERM); // Add SIGTERM to the signal set
sigaddset(&sigset, SIGHUP); // Add SIGHUP to the signal set
```
Use the sigprocmask function to block the signals in the signal set. You can pass SIG_BLOCK as the second argument to block the signals, or SIG_UNBLOCK to unblock them.
```
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &sigset, NULL); // Block the signals in the signal set
```
Perform any actions that you want to take while the signals are blocked.
Use the sigprocmask function again to unblock the signals.
```
sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &sigset, NULL); // Unblock the signals in the signal set
```
You can also use the sigpending function to check which signals are currently blocked and pending delivery. This can be useful if you want to handle the signals at a later time, rather than immediately unblocking them.

It's important to note that using sigprocmask to block signals can be a bit tricky, as it can potentially lead to race conditions or other issues if not used carefully. In particular, you should be careful not to block signals that your program depends on, such as SIGSEGV or SIGABRT, as this can cause your program to become unresponsive.
