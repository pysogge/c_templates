// Parallelization: You can use the pthreads (POSIX threads) library to create and manage threads for parallel execution of code. By dividing a task into smaller pieces and executing them concurrently on different processors or cores, you can improve performance by taking advantage of the available computing resources.
// Vectorization: You can use vectorization techniques to optimize the performance of loops that operate on arrays of data. By using specialized instructions that operate on multiple data elements at once, you can achieve significant performance improvements.
// Optimization: You can use optimization techniques to improve the performance of your code by reducing the number of instructions that need to be executed and minimizing the use of resources such as memory and cache. You can use optimization options provided by your compiler, such as -O2 or -O3, to enable optimization at the source code level.
// Hardware acceleration: You can use hardware acceleration techniques to offload computationally intensive tasks to specialized hardware devices, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), in order to improve performance.

// The following code snippet shows how to use the pthreads library to create and manage threads for parallel execution of code. The code snippet also shows how to use the _mm_load_ps, _mm_set1_ps, _mm_mul_ps, and _mm_store_ps functions from the SSE intrinsics library to perform vectorized operations on arrays of data.
